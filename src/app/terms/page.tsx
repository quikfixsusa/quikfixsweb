          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">4. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATFORM </h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            QuikFixs is a technology platform that operates through a mobile application designed to facilitate
            connections between users who require everyday services and qualified local contractors who offer them. The
            platform allows users to select from a variety of predefined services, customize their request according to
            the available options, and automatically assign a suitable contractor to carry out the work. QuikFixs&apos;
            goal is to simplify the management and resolution of domestic and technical tasks through an efficient,
            intuitive, and secure experience. Services are provided directly by independent contractors, and QuikFixs
            acts solely as a technological intermediary between both parties, providing the necessary tools to
            facilitate the request, assignment, coordination, and monitoring of services.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">5. CONTRACTORS</h2>

            <strong>5.1. Registration and profile account</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To access QuikFixs&apos; features as a Contractor, you must complete the registration process on the
            platform by creating a personal account. The user must provide accurate, current, and verifiable
            information, including, but not limited to, full name, telephone number, email address, specialties or
            categories of services offered, availability, geographical coverage area, and any other information required
            by the platform for verification purposes, service assignment, or compliance with quality standards. The
            Contractor declares that all information provided is true and agrees to keep it up to date at all times. The
            Contractor also acknowledges that QuikFixs may require additional documentation to validate their identity
            or experience, and that the omission or falsification of such information may result in the immediate
            suspension or cancellation of the account, without prejudice to any other actions that may be taken.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The Contractor&apos;s profile may be visible to Customers to the extent necessary to facilitate the
            provision of the requested service, including elements such as name, qualifications, ratings, services
            offered, and area of operation. The Contractor is responsible for the proper use of their account and agrees
            not to share their login credentials with third parties. Any activity carried out through the registered
            account will be considered to have been carried out by the account holder. QuikFixs reserves the right to
            accept, reject, or cancel Contractor registrations at any time, as well as to establish minimum performance
            or compliance requirements to maintain access to the platform.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.2. Service requests</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Contractors registered with QuikFixs may receive notifications through the platform when they are assigned a
            service request corresponding to their specialty, geographical availability, and other relevant criteria.
            Each request will include the necessary details for the Contractor to evaluate the proposed work, including
            the service category, task description, location, date, time, and specific conditions established by the
            Customer. The Contractor must carefully review this information and expressly accept the request from their
            account within the specified time frame to confirm their availability and commitment to providing the
            service.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Acceptance of a request implies the Contractor&apos;s obligation to arrive promptly at the designated
            location on the agreed date and time and to perform the service in a professional and diligent manner and in
            accordance with the quality standards expected by the platform. By accepting a request, the Contractor also
            assumes responsibility for completing the assigned service in its entirety, except for justified causes that
            must be reported immediately through the channels provided by QuikFixs.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The Contractor understands and accepts that failure to respond to multiple requests, repeated cancellations,
            or failure to perform the services may affect their visibility and reputation on the platform, and may even
            result in the temporary or permanent suspension of their account. QuikFixs reserves the right to establish
            internal performance and compliance criteria to evaluate the behavior of Contractors within the system, in
            order to ensure a satisfactory and safe experience for all users.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.3. Commissions, payouts, and withdrawals</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Contractors who successfully complete services through the QuikFixs platform will be entitled to withdraw
            the earnings corresponding to those services, which will be calculated once the completion of the work has
            been confirmed by the Customer or through the internal verification mechanisms established by the platform.
            Payment will be processed through the withdrawal methods enabled in the Contractor&apos;s account, which
            must be correctly configured by the user to allow the transfer of funds. The crediting of payments is
            subject to the operating terms established by the associated payment service providers, as well as
            QuikFixs&apos; internal review procedures.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            For each service completed through the platform, QuikFixs will apply a previously established commission,
            which will be automatically deducted from the total amount paid by the Customer. The percentage of this
            commission may vary depending on the type of service, the region, or other specific conditions communicated
            to the Contractor in a timely manner. The remaining amount, after deducting the commission, will be
            considered the Contractor&apos;s net earnings and will be credited to their account available for
            withdrawal.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The Contractor acknowledges and accepts that the commission constitutes legitimate remuneration for the use
            of the infrastructure, technology, promotion, support, and other tools provided by QuikFixs to facilitate
            the generation of job opportunities through the platform. Likewise, the Contractor is responsible for
            complying with all tax obligations that may arise from the income received for the provision of services,
            without QuikFixs having any obligation to make tax withholdings or contributions, unless expressly required
            by applicable law. The availability of funds for withdrawal may be subject to identity verification,
            compliance with quality standards, or resolution of active disputes on the platform, according to current
            internal policies.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>5.4. Rules of Conduct</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Contractors registered on the QuikFixs platform agree to comply at all times with the rules of conduct
            established by the company, in order to ensure a professional, safe, and satisfactory experience for all
            users. The relationship between Contractors and Customers is based on mutual respect, trust, and the quality
            of the service provided, and any breach of these rules may result in the suspension or cancellation of the
            account, without prejudice to other actions that QuikFixs deems appropriate. In this regard, Contractors
            must observe the following rules of conduct during their use of the platform and in the performance of
            services:
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-8 list-inside list-disc">
            <li>
              Act with honesty, integrity, and professionalism in all interactions with Customers, other users, and
              representatives of QuikFixs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arrive promptly at the agreed location and time to provide services, except for justified reasons
              communicated in a timely manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Perform each service with due diligence, care, and quality, in accordance with the Customer&apos;s
              specifications and generally accepted practices in the area of expertise.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintain respectful language and behavior at all times, avoiding offensive, aggressive, discriminatory, or
              inappropriate expressions, both in communications and in person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Respect the privacy and personal data of Customers, refraining from using, storing or disclosing such

            </li>
            <li>
              Not request or accept payments outside the platform for services rendered, unless expressly authorized in
              writing by QuikFixs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refrain from attempting to contact Customers directly to offer services outside the platform, which will
              be considered a serious violation of the contractual terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not engage in conduct that could damage the reputation of the platform or cause harm to other users,
              including deceptive practices, repeated breaches, misuse of the system, or manipulation of ratings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promptly inform QuikFixs of any incident, complaint, conflict, or irregularity that occurs during the
              provision of the service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Comply with all legal and regulatory provisions applicable to the type of service offered, including
              licenses, permits, or technical requirements required by local regulations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Compliance with these rules is essential to preserve the quality and reliability of the QuikFixs ecosystem.
            The platform may conduct audits, reviews, or internal investigations to verify the behavior of Contractors
            and take the necessary corrective measures, including warnings, temporary suspensions, permanent account
            deactivations, or legal action, as appropriate.

            <strong>6.1. Registration</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To use the services available on QuikFixs, Customers must register on the platform by creating a personal
            account. The registration process requires the user to provide accurate, complete, and current information,
            including, but not limited to, full name, telephone number, email address, address where the services will
            be provided, and any other information that the platform deems necessary for the proper assignment and
            execution of the requested services. The Customer declares that all information provided is true and
            undertakes to keep it up to date at all times. The omission, inaccuracy or falsity of the data provided may
            result in the suspension or cancellation of the account, without prejudice to any other actions that may be
            applicable.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The Customer is responsible for the diligent use of their account and undertakes not to share their access
            credentials with third parties. Any request or activity carried out from their account will be understood to
            have been made by the registered owner, who will be solely responsible for the consequences arising from its
            use. QuikFixs may, at any time, establish identity verification or validation requirements, as well as
            implement security mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the platform&apos;s use. The creation and use of
            the account imply full acceptance of these terms and conditions, as well as the Customer&apos;s commitment
            to use the platform in accordance with its legitimate purpose and under the principles of good faith and
            respect for other users.
          </p>

            <strong>6.2. Service requests</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Customers registered with QuikFixs may make service requests through the platform by selecting the
            appropriate category from among the services offered, which include, but are not limited to, plumbing,
            electrical, cleaning, computer assistance, gardening, beauty services, and general maintenance. Once the
            category has been selected, the Customer must provide the information necessary to define the request
            accurately, including a clear description of the problem or need, the exact location where the service is to
            be provided, the preferred date and time, as well as any other relevant information that will facilitate the
            proper execution of the work.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Once the required fields have been completed, the Customer may review all the details of the request and
            must confirm its submission so that it can be processed by the platform. By confirming the request, the
            Customer authorizes QuikFixs to automatically assign a qualified Contractor, taking into account various
            factors such as the required specialty, availability, geographical location, and performance history of the
            professional. The Customer will be notified through the application once a Contractor has been assigned, and
            will be able to access the necessary information to track the request.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The Contractor will arrive at the agreed place and time to perform the service. The Customer undertakes to
            provide access to the place where the work is to be carried out and to ensure that the minimum conditions
            for its proper performance are met. They also undertake to be available or to leave a responsible person in
            charge to receive the professional and supervise the start of the work. By confirming the request, the
            Customer expresses their intention to receive the service, assumes the corresponding payment obligation once
            the service has been provided, and undertakes to act in good faith and cordially in their relationship with
            the assigned Contractor.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>6.3. Payments</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To complete a service request through the QuikFixs platform, the Customer must make the payment
            corresponding to the selected service at the time of confirming the request, and before the assignment of a
            Contractor is made. The amount to be paid will be determined based on the category of service, the custom
            options selected by the Customer, and any other parameters that may affect the final price, which will be
            clearly stated prior to confirmation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Payment will be made through the electronic methods enabled on the platform, such as credit cards, debit
            cards, or other online payment methods managed by external secure payment service providers. Once payment
            has been made and the request confirmed, QuikFixs will begin the process of automatically assigning the most
            suitable Contractor based on the nature of the service, location, availability, and other operational
            criteria. The Customer acknowledges and accepts that the assignment of a Contractor will only be possible
            once payment has been successfully verified.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The amount paid will be securely retained by the system until the service has been completed, at which point
            the payment corresponding to the Contractor will be processed. If a Contractor cannot be assigned within the
            reasonable time frame established by the platform or if the request is canceled in accordance with the
            applicable cancellation conditions, the amount may be refunded to the Customer in accordance with the
            current refund policy. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that the payment method used is valid,
            active, and has sufficient funds. Any attempt at fraud, misuse, or refusal of payment may result in account
            suspension and appropriate legal action.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 text-2xl">
            <strong>6.4. Credit Card Authorization</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            To ensure the validity of payment methods and prevent unauthorized activity, QuikFixs may perform
            pre-authorizations when adding a new payment method or making a request. Although these authorizations do
            not constitute a charge, they may temporarily reduce the available credit on your bank account. Users are
            responsible for any additional charges, such as overdrafts, resulting from these authorizations. QuikFixs is
            not responsible for these costs and recommends contacting the issuing bank for more information on such
            transactions.

            <strong>6.5. Credits and Discounts</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            QuikFixs may offer, at its sole discretion, promotional credits and discounts to Contractor users as part of
            commercial campaigns, loyalty programs, performance incentives, or other promotional activities. These
            credits and discounts may be applicable exclusively to the payment of services, fees, or specific features
            within the platform, as indicated in the specific terms of each promotion. The availability, conditions of
            use, validity, and application of these benefits will be determined by QuikFixs and may be modified or
            canceled at any time without prior notice.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Promotional credits and discounts are personal, non-transferable, and cannot be sold, exchanged, or redeemed
            for cash, except in cases where applicable law expressly requires it. They also cannot be combined with
            other promotions unless otherwise indicated in the terms of the corresponding offer. These benefits may only
            be applied to base rates defined by QuikFixs and will not be valid to cover commissions, penalties,
            cancellation fees, or other additional costs arising from the use of the platform.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            If the value of the service or fee exceeds the amount of the credit or discount available, the Contractor
            will be responsible for paying the difference using the payment method registered in their account. If no
            valid payment method is available or if the additional payment cannot be processed, the use of the credit or
            discount may be rejected or the transaction may be canceled. QuikFixs reserves the right to revoke, suspend,
            or cancel any credit or discount granted when it detects misuse, fraud, or use contrary to the terms and
            conditions of the platform.

          <p className="mb-8">
            QuikFixs acts exclusively as a technological platform that facilitates the connection between Customers and
            independent Contractors for the request and provision of various predefined services. Under no circumstances
            shall QuikFixs be considered part of the contractual relationship that arises directly between the Customer
            and the Contractor as a result of a service request through the application. Contractors are independent
            service providers who are not employed by, affiliated with, or contracted by QuikFixs beyond their use of
            the platform to offer their services. Therefore, QuikFixs does not directly supervise or control the
            performance of the work, technical suitability, conduct, or results of the services performed by
            Contractors, and assumes no responsibility for damages, losses, or harm arising directly or indirectly from
            the performance or non-performance by Contractors.

            from the use of devices, internet connections or other factors beyond its control. Access to and use of the
            platform is at the sole responsibility of the user, who assumes the risks arising from the use of digital
            tools and interaction with independent third parties. Likewise, QuikFixs shall not be liable for financial
            losses, indirect damages, loss of profits, loss of data, failure to deliver notifications, errors in the
            information provided by users, or any other damage arising from the use or inability to use the platform.

            acts of God, force majeure, natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of government authorities, failures in
            third-party services, or interruptions in the digital infrastructure. In any case, QuikFixs&apos; total
            liability to users for any claim arising from these terms and conditions or from the use of the platform
            shall be limited to the total amount actually paid by the user through the platform in the thirty (30) days

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">18. SEVERABILITY</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            If any section of these terms is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
            enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired. Our failure to
            enforce or delay in enforcing any provision of these terms at any time does not waive our right to enforce
            the same or any other provision in the future.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">19. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">

            including, without limitation, fortuitous events, acts of civil authorities, acts of military authorities,
            riots, embargoes, acts of nature and natural disasters, and other acts that may be due to unforeseen
            circumstances.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">20. TERMINATION</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Both the user and QuikFixs acknowledge that failure to comply with these terms and conditions may result in
            termination of the agreement between both parties.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            In case of non-compliance by the user: If the user fails to comply with any of the terms set forth in these
            terms and conditions, QuikFixs reserves the right to unilaterally terminate the user&apos;s access to and
            use of the platform. QuikFixs may take this action without prior notice, and the User will automatically
            lose all rights to access and use the platform. Furthermore, QuikFixs shall not be liable for any loss of
            data or information associated with the user&apos;s account.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            In case of non-compliance by QuikFixs: If QuikFixs fails to comply with its obligations under the agreed
            terms and conditions, the User shall be entitled to terminate the agreement and stop using the platform. The
            user shall notify QuikFixs in writing of the breach and allow a reasonable time for QuikFixs to remedy the
            situation. If QuikFixs does not remedy the breach within the set period, the user may proceed with the
            termination of the agreement.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Termination of the agreement shall not release either party from any obligations and liabilities that have
            arisen prior to the date of termination.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Continued use of the platform after termination of the agreement by either party shall imply acceptance of
            the conditions set forth in the terms and conditions in effect at that time.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">21. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Any dispute, claim or controversy arising between a user and QuikFixs in connection with these terms and
            conditions, the use of the platform or the services provided, shall be resolved exclusively through
            alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including mediation and arbitration, as detailed below.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            First, both parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve any dispute informally. This includes direct
            communication between the parties involved to identify and address concerns or disagreements quickly and
            efficiently. Users may contact QuikFixs through designated support channels to raise any disputes. The
            company commits to respond within a reasonable period of time, providing an opportunity to resolve the issue
            without resorting to formal procedures.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            If the parties fail to resolve the dispute informally within thirty (30) days of initial notification of the
            dispute, the dispute will be submitted to mediation. The mediation shall be conducted before a neutral
            mediator selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator
            within an additional fifteen (15) days, a mediator shall be appointed through a recognized mediation agency.
            The costs of the mediation shall be shared equally between the parties, and the mediation shall be conducted
            in English and at a mutually agreed location or, if both parties agree, through a virtual platform.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            If mediation does not result in a mutually satisfactory resolution, the dispute shall be resolved by binding
            arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association
            (AAA) or a similar internationally recognized body. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral
            arbitrator, who shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the arbitration body. The place of
            arbitration shall be in the city of Orlando, Florida, USA. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve the dispute, including determining the
            applicability and validity of these dispute resolution terms. The arbitrator&apos;s decision shall be final
            and binding on both parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Unless
            prohibited by applicable law, the parties agree to waive any right to bring the dispute in court or to
            participate in a class action.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            This dispute resolution clause does not preclude QuikFixs from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in the
            event of intellectual property rights infringement, misuse of the platform, or any act that may cause
            irreparable harm, in which case it may go directly to a court of competent jurisdiction without exhausting
            alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            By accepting these terms, users expressly waive any right to a jury trial and agree that all disputes will
            be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this clause, with the objective of minimizing the
            costs and time associated with formal litigation. The parties assume their own costs associated with
            mediation and arbitration, unless otherwise agreed or specifically provided by the arbitrator.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-8 text-4xl font-semibold">22. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
          <p className="mb-8">

            States, specifically the laws of the State of Florida. Any dispute relating to these terms shall be subject
            to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the State of Florida. This applies unless
            binding arbitration is agreed to in the applicable section.
